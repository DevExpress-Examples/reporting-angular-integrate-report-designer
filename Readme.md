# How to use the Web Report Designer in JavaScript with Angular

This example demonstrates how to use theÂ <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/XtraReports/17103/Concepts/End-User-Reporting/ASP-NET/End-User-Report-Designer-for-ASP-NET">End-User Web Report Designer</a> Â in JavaScript withÂ <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>.

The example consists of two parts:Â 

1. A server (backend)Â project in the ASP.NET MVC implementation, where cross-domain requests are enabled (Access-Control-Allow-Origin) and custom report storage is implemented.

2. An Angular client application (frontend) thatÂ includes necessary styles, scripts, and HTML-templates.Â Two client-side implementations are available in this example: Angular 2+ and Angular 5+. 

To download all the required client resources for deploying the control, navigate to the client part's root folder, open the console, and run the following command:

```npm install```


To enable the example proper operation, first run the backend project in Visual Studio and then run the client part using the command below depending on the Angular version:

 * Angular 2+

    ```npm start```
 
 * Angular 5+

    ```ng serve```

Open your browser on <a href="http://localhost:4200/">http://localhost:4200/</a> to see the result.
